Self-made, young Front End Developer / Web designer. Started my coding journey in 2018, going through Python and Java. In March 2019 fell in love with front end development and dedicating myself to this till today. Looking for a job to match my passion and raise my skills to a higher levels. Want to learn new technologies such as PHP, query languages and Javascript Frameworks (especially Angular and Vue.js). Following latest trends in UX/UI and front end approaches.

There aren't many so far, but a lot of my works went straight to the bin, because I was starting projects and halfway realize I could done this 10 times faster and better so I decided to make this again from zero othertime.

###### About
Site made for Gdańsk University of Technology science club - SimLE. I've got quite strict requirements about project: content should be given from markdown file, preferred using gatsby, modern look and posting blogs feature. I've learned a lot from this project, things like React lifecycle understanding, using Gatsby.js, prototyping in Adobe XD, getting and parsing data from markdown files and optimalization for decent speed. I've received very good feedback.

###### About
Making this one gave me a lot of fun, I decided to keep with modern trends in UX/UI such as strong typhography, scrolling/interactive effects, dark themed layout. Decided to use gatsby, because I really like how fast these websites can go with still solid SEO.
